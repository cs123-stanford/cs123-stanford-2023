Schedule
===========

**Week 1** 9/25
No Class! School starts on a Tuesday (for some reason...), so we will have our first class on Monday week 2!

**Week 2** 10/2
* Lecture on BLDC robot actuators and low-level PID control of robot joints.
* :doc:`../course-material/lab-1` Introduction to Teensy microcontroller. Mechatronics assembly. Experimenting with PID to move BLDC actuators to desired angles. Moving three actuators simultaneously. 
* :doc:`../course-material/lab-2` Build 3-DOF leader-follower robot arms akin to a surgical robotic system.

**Week 2** 10/9

* Lecture on forward kinematics of open-chain robots and applications.
* :doc:`../course-material/lab-3` Program the robot to tell you the cartesian coordinates of the leg for any given position. Staying within a cartesian-space safety box with haptic feedback. 

**Week 3** 10/16

* Lecture on inverse kinematics of open-chain robots and applications
* :doc:`../course-material/lab-4` Program legs to move to desired locations using inverse kinematics. Finally, drawing images with a robot arm! Task-space impedance control if time allows.

**Week 4** 10/23

* Lecture on model-based gait control: e.g. theory behind gallop, walk, trot, etc and associated stability.
* :doc:`../course-material/lab-5` Program the robot to trot using open-loop task-space trajectories. Simulating the robot in PyBullet to design and test code before deploying in the real world.

**Week 5**
* Lecture on Reinforcement Learning for quadruped robots, and SOTA RL simulation techniques
* :doc:`../course-material/lab-6` Students build full Pupper robot.

**Week 6**

* Survey of topics to explore in the final project including reinforcement learning, computer vision, hardware redesign, human interaction. 
* Google Brain guest lecture.
* Students brainstorm project ideas, do background research, and determine final project.

**Week 7**

* Mini-lectures on any additional material students might find useful for their project.
* Open lab time to work on final projects

**Week 8**

* Students present project prototype

**Week 9**

* Open lab time

**Week 10**

* Students finish final project and showcase to faculty and Google Brain.

**Week 11 (finals week)**

* Students upload code, documentation, and media so that future students / hobbyists can recreate their work.
* Play with robots!
